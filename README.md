# Hi, I'm Gerard ! — Soon -> Junior SOC Analyst

I’m currently building strong foundations of **cybersecurity** skills and IT after building a strong foundation in **Python**, **SQL**, and the fundamentals of **full-stack development**. My passion now lies in **digital defense** — protecting systems, data, and people from threats through hands-on learning, structured practice, and real-world simulations.

## About Me:

* **Calm under pressure** — I thrive in high-stakes situations like incident response.
* **Analytical thinker** — I enjoy breaking down problems and spotting vulnerabilities.
* **Lifelong learner** — I'm committed to continuous upskilling and technical excellence.
* **Security-focused** — I’m fascinated by ethical hacking, incident response, and system hardening.
* **Multilingual & global-minded** — I speak 5 languages fluently and love international collaboration.

My GitHub is where I share not just my progress, but my process — especially now that I’m documenting my journey into cybersecurity with labs, challenges, and theory notes.

## My Vision

This portfolio is more than a project collection — it’s a transparent journal of my evolution. I treat cybersecurity the same way I approached programming: by practicing daily, building a homelab, and sharing what I learn.

I aim to land an entry-level cybersecurity analyst position where I can contribute meaningfully to threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and security operations.

### Each repo includes:

* What I tested and built
* What I investigated
* Tools and techniques I used
* Lessons learned and concepts mastered

## Career Goal

Start as a junior SOC analyst, protecting networks and digital assets through a mix of vigilance, technical skills, and fast decision-making. In the future, transition into Threat Hunting or Pentesting. I’m passionate about defending systems before, during, and after attacks.
